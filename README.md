# marbotte_util

CRASH: It seems not possible to use an underscore in the name of a package... I will migrate all the package to a new repository with a correct name soon!

Utility functions in a R-package format for ecological data management and analysis

The idea of the package here is to be able to share, and install easily all the R functions that facilitate my data management and analysis in R.
On the long term, the idea would be to develop classes, functions to export and import data between the softwares I use in ecology, automated analyses using methods from other package etc.

Note that I use mostly postgreSQL for storing my data, postgis and OTB for the spatial analyses, vegan and ade4 in R.
I work mostly in linux, use sed and awk among other bash tools.
So, the *marbotte\_util* package will mostly include functions related to the possibilities provided in these softwares
